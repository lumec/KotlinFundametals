//Recommendations:
// 1. Make your data as immutable or unchangeable as possible
// 2- Make your data as private as possible

//const and val are read-only references

/*
Constants:
 1. can just hold primitive types or Strings

      Primitive data types:

                 |-Byte
      *Integer ->|-Short
                 |-Int
                 |-Long


      *Floating-Point->|-Double
                       |-Float

      *Boolean

      *Character

 2. Their values are known at compile time

 3. not need to be created over and over again. They improve efficiency of the program because
 a space in memory is assigned specifically for them

 Use them when the information is always the same even when the program runs
*/
const val TAKE_PHOTO_CODE = 101

// If the information is only used in specific places, consider making it private or protected
private const val ADD = "+"


/*
Val:
 1. The value is assigned at runtime

 Use it when the information is unchangeable during the runtime but changes every time the program runs
 Example: to store a value fetched from internet
